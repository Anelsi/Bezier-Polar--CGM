Interactive JavaFX application for geometric modeling of arbitrary-degree Bézier curves using the de Casteljau algorithm. The user creates the control polygon by adding, moving, and deleting control points directly on the canvas. The program renders the Bézier curve, shows the current point B(t) for a chosen parameter t, visualizes intermediate de Casteljau levels, and supports step-by-step curve construction with an adjustable dt for smoothness.
